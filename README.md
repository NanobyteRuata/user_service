# RExpense User Service (Archived)

‚ö†Ô∏è **This repository is no longer maintained.**

The user_service has been migrated to the new [RExpense Monorepo](https://github.com/NanobyteRuata/rexpense), which now contains all services and infrastructure for the RExpense project.

## üì¶ Where is Development Happening Now?

All new development, updates, and issues for the user service and the entire RExpense project are now managed in the monorepo:

## Why the Change?

- Easier development and deployment with a single repository for all microservices
- Unified configuration, documentation, and CI/CD
- Better support for event-driven architecture and cross-service features

## What if I Need the Old Code?

This repository will remain available in read-only mode for historical reference, but it will not receive any further updates or support.
